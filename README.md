# Google Action: DMV_Metro
A voice skill that we have built using the Google Actions Console. This skill aims to give users quick access to real-time train information in D.C. We have also built a similar skill on the Alexa Skill Console. Check [this repository](https://github.com/chingachleung/Alexa_Skill_DMV_Metro) out if you are planning to build your skill on their console, or if you are comparing the two platforms. 

Check out [this Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/overview)to understand understand some of the fundamentals of building a voice skill on their console.
